# IOEAdmissionListScraper
Retrieves lists of applicants from IOE admissions website.

The source website is https://admission.ioe.edu.np/AllApplicantList
I created a simple python script to perform the task of fetching "admission list"s that is normally doable repetitively using the query form 
presented in the webpage. Because why not.
Uses BeautifulSoup and Requests and Json modules.
It's in Python 3
